\usage{
cal_stat(
  data_obj,
  group,
  meta_data = NULL,
  assay_name = "logcounts",
  filter_rare_ct = TRUE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_obj}{SingleCellExperiment object}

\item{group}{The column name in metadata for grouping}

\item{meta_data}{A cell (column) metadata dataframe. Rownames of the data frame should be the same as the colnames of the expression matrix (keep cell ID order correct).}

\item{assay_name}{The name of the assay to extract}

\item{filter_rare_ct}{If cell groups with too few cells should be filtered out. By default this is set to TRUE because these groups may be contaminants or something else.}

\item{filter_thres}{If filter_rare_ct is TRUE, what cells we are going to filter out?}

\item{mean_only}{If only mean expression value calculated?}
}
\value{
A SingleCellExperiment object
}
